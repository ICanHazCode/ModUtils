# ICanHazCode.ModUtils

Extension module used in BepInEx-based mods to help simplify certain transpiler functionality.

## Releases

First version is available in [Releases](http://github.com/ICanHazCode/ModUtils/releases).
Newer versions will add bits as I delve deeper into transpiler modding.

## Building
You need to set your Reference Paths for the project to your BepInEx install
 - {BepInEx game folder/BepInEx work folder}/core


## Installation

The [ICanHazCode.ModUtils.dll]() needs to be put in your BepInEx\core folder of your game for any/all mods that need it to work.
Any new versions should be compatible with the original.
